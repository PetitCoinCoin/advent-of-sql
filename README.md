A new advent calendar! https://adventofsql.com

I realised I had very basic knowledge in SQL, so I thought this challenge would be a good opportunity to learn. I use a postgres DB.

Day 1: learnt about JSON fields manipulation

Day 2: learnt about string manipulation

Day 3: learnt about XML parsing and array manipulation

Day 4: learnt about functions (thx to Erwin Brandstetter on Stack Overflow), and sorting with NULL

Day 5: learnt about LAG and LEAD to get next and previous rows

Day 6: nothing fancy today

Day 7: learnt about DISTINCT ON

Day 8: learnt about recursive CTE, and had the opportunity to apply what was learnt on day 4!

Day 9: nothing fancy today, it could probably be optimized.

Day 10: could have used CASE, but wanted to try something new with FILTER

Day 11: thought I could use LAG, but just a simple function. Probably not the most efficient approach.

Day 12: learnt about PERCENT_RANK and DISTINCT ON

Day 13: learnt about UNNEST and SPLIT_PART

Day 14: JSON manipulation again

Day 15: Well, I didn't manage to correctly setup DB with Postgis extension, and I don't want to spend some time on this now. Too bad I guess I could have learnt about coordinates manipulation. Nevertheless, I used the DBFiddle to solve this, and I just looked at the data. Obviously, this wouldn't have worked with more data...

Day 16: Let's see when I'll setup a correct environnment

Day 17: learnt that datetime manipulain is as painful in SQL as in any other language

Day 18: Re-used day 8

Day 19: learnt about CROSS JOIN (and try to do some optimization after my first successful attempt)

Day 20: learnt about string manipulation, POSITION
