A new advent calendar! https://adventofsql.com

I realised I had very basic knowledge in SQL, so I thought this challenge would be a good opportunity to learn. I use a postgres DB.

Day 1: learnt about JSON fields manipulation

Day 2: learnt about string manipulation

Day 3: learnt about XML parsing and array manipulation

Day 4: learnt about functions (thx to Erwin Brandstetter on Stack Overflow), and sorting with NULL

Day 5: learnt about LAG and LEAD to get next and previous rows

Day 6: nothing fancy today

Day 7: learnt about DISTINCT ON

Day 8: learnt about recursive CTE, and had the opportunity to apply what was learnt on day 4!
