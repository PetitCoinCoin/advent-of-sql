A new advent calendar! https://adventofsql.com

I realised I had very basic knowledge in SQL, so I thought this challenge would be a good opportunity to learn. I use a postgres DB.

Day 1: learnt about JSON fields manipulation

Day 2: learnt about string manipulation

Day 3: learnt about XML parsing and array manipulation
